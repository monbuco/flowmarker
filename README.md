# FlowMark Writer

FlowMark Writer is a desktop-first writing environment focused on clean content,
long-term knowledge preservation, and distraction-free writing.

It is designed for authors, researchers, journalists, and thinkers who want
to write freely without being constrained by layout, pages, or excessive
formatting decisions.

The editor separates content from presentation and uses Markdown as its base,
with support for FlowMark (FLM), a lightweight, extensible format for portable
knowledge.

## Principles

- Content over layout
- No page concept, fluid reading and writing
- Keyboard-first writing
- Clean, durable source formats
- Export to existing standards (Markdown, HTML, EPUB, PDF)
- Desktop-first, digital-native

## Status

This project is in early development.
Expect breaking changes.
